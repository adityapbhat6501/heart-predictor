# Heart Disease Predictor 💓

This project is a Machine Learning based **Heart Disease Prediction System** that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient tool that assists in early risk detection and preventive healthcare decisions.

## 📌 Features
- Takes medical parameter inputs from the user
- Uses a trained Machine Learning model to make predictions
- Provides clear output: **Heart Disease Detected / Not Detected**
- Easy to use interface (GUI / Streamlit / Flask)
- Lightweight and fast prediction

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a reliable system that can analyze patient health data and **predict the likelihood of heart disease** using machine learning techniques, enabling early diagnosis and improving healthcare outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model Used
- **Logistic Regression** (or the model you used — update if different)
- Dataset used: **Heart Disease Dataset** (UCI Repository / Kaggle)
